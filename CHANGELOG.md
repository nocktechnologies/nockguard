All notable changes to NockGuard are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added
- `nockguard selftest` — proof-of-block self-test (N9070). Proves the live
  enforcement path actually **blocks**: a policy-denied canary tool is denied at
  the proxy gate, and a synthetic secret-shaped argument is caught by input
  validation. Distinct from `audit verify`, which proves audit-**trail**
  integrity. Each check runs a positive control (the probe must forward *without*
  the control under test) so a block is real, not a setup error; a positive-
  control miss is `SKIP`, never `PASS`. Exit `0` = enforcement proven, `2` = a
  gap, `1` = inconclusive (including no active policy). Supports `--json`.
- `policy.LoadBytes` — parse a policy from raw YAML through the same loader and
  validation as `policy.Load`.
